# Holiday Split

public/            the app (index.html), offline support (sw.js), icons and manifest
worker.js          sync API (/api/ping, /api/trip/<id>)
wrangler.jsonc     config: static assets + KV namespace "TRIPS"

## Tests
npm install
npm test      (25 tests: split maths, settling, couples, payments, currencies, amount entry, dates, worker sync, photos, link reset and encryption)

## Deploy (one time)
1. npx wrangler login
2. npx wrangler kv namespace create TRIPS
   Paste the printed id into wrangler.jsonc
3. Set "name" in wrangler.jsonc to your existing Worker's name
4. npx wrangler deploy

## Privacy
New trips are end-to-end encrypted (AES-GCM). The key is the part of the invite link after the dot
(#tripid.key); it never reaches the server, so the Worker and the Cloudflare dashboard only see ciphertext.
Older plain trips keep working; Settings -> Encrypt moves one to a new encrypted link.
If every copy of a link is lost, the trip cannot be recovered.
